By using the above template enclosed in "" generate the suitable environment script written in .sh that will Automate the creation of environment for assessing security posture on BeEF  . Also generate the environment script configurable by having a configuration file written in YAML format.  I wanted to use the following assessment tools Semgrep, CodeQL, Bandit, FindSecBugs,OWASP, Syft, Grype, Trivy, CycloneDX CLI, ScanCode ToolKit, SPDX tool. The environment script should also install all necessary prerequisites like git, LLMs, Dependencies, tools, sdk etc that required to perform the assessment.  Make sure there are enough comments to understand the code & Proper intending are there in the script. Do not use Ansible and also do not use extra helper function apart from the above mentioned. code for loading the YAML file is required.
*Important note : Use the correct and valid git repository URLs*
