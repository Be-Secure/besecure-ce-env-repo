Create a shell script that sets up an environment for the security assessment of the Scikit-Learn project. The script should include five lifecycle functions: __besman_install, __besman_uninstall, __besman_update, __besman_validate, and __besman_reset.

__besman_install should install all necessary dependencies, including Docker, Go, and security tools like Criticality Score, SonarQube, Fossology, and spdx-sbom-generator. It should also clone the source code and assessment datastore repositories.
__besman_uninstall should remove all installed tools and dependencies, ensuring clean removal of Docker containers and Go packages.
__besman_update should update Scikit-Learn and its core dependencies to their latest versions.
__besman_validate should check that all tools and dependencies are correctly installed and running, verifying Docker containers, Go installation, and other essential tools.
__besman_reset should reset the environment by uninstalling and reinstalling all tools and dependencies, ensuring a fresh setup.
